**Scrap & Trace**, created by a group of students from Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh, Scotland, is an app that aims to incorporate the use of augmented reality (AR) in the creation of 'scrapbooks', collections of memories that can be shared with others. The app is designed to be used by anyone, and is intended to be a fun and easy way to create and share memories with others. Scrap & Trace was active during the academic year of 2022/2023, and is no longer being maintained. 

The app was developed as part of a group project for our third year Software Engineering and Professional Development modules. You can find the source code for the app we developed on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/scrap-and-trace/ScrapAppReact).

The team have since graduated from the university, so no support will be provided if you encounter any issues with the app. You should still be able to clone the repository and run the app locally if you wish to do so.
